                <p>Abazibu understand that money is an important part of our wellbeing. That saving is very important step towards prosperity.
                    It is as such, that we started a Savings and Credit Co-operative Society(Sacco) in 2013 as mainly as a way to encourage us to save.
                    Three years(3) down the road, our Sacco has grown in leaps and bounds. Our members save monthly and they are able to get hustle-free
                    loans at very low interest rates; actually lower than the market rate. Our vision is to one day own a Commercial bank.</p>

                img-responsive" />
                <p>A muzibu's wellbeing is at the core of the Abazibu fraternity, so we came up with a fund that we named "Abazibu Social Fund".
                    We are always involved in each other's social ceremonies and functions. Some of these events we plan, others are not planned
                    such as the tragic loss of a loved one. We make monthly contributions to this fund, and when a muzibu has a social event,
                    we pull a certain percentage of money out of the fund and offer it to a member. However, members are also personally required
                    to contribute a fixed amount of money towards the occasion. This money comes in handy since these events require quite a huge
                    amount of money that may not be available at the time. It is also a show of brotherhood towards a fellow muzibu.

                <p>"Work without play makes Jack a dull boy" so goes the old adage. Back in the day, during our days at Jovoc, we used to
                    play football in a small league, whereby we created teams among ourselves and played against each other. We coined a name for it,
                    "Zibs League". We still play though our league died out. However, we are working on reviving it.</p>

        <h3 id="host" align="center">Host Us</h3>

                img-responsive" />
                <p>Building a strong social bond with each other is something we take seriously. So, we came up with the idea of having
                    each muzibu have a chance of hosting at their home. We contribute a small amount of money to assist the host in the preparations.
                    This gives us an opportunity of getting to know each other better and in the long run strengthen our bond.</p>

                <p>A dinner is held annually, usually around the month of March. This is the time we meet together to eat and have fun,
                    plus do a recollection of the past year. We elect new leaders every year, so it is also at this dinner, that the outgoing leaders
                    handover the mantle of leadership to new leaders. It is also one of those times, that we get to meet our long lost brothers.</p>
